<font size= '18' color='#ab2b2c' face='RobotoCondensedBold'>Player Settings</font><br />
<br />
One of the new features of the NAK PAD is the ability to change your players settings:<br />
The Player settings currently consist of Name Color, Player Marker Color, Recoil Multiplier, Sway Percent,Halo Jump Altitude,Players Marker Range and Player 3D Marker<br />

<font size= '14' color='#fce253' face='RobotoCondensedBold'>Name Color</font><br />
The Name Color option allows you to change the color in which the names of the players are displayed, you can select them from a drop down list which will give you a decent amount of colors to pick from. On the right of the NAK Pad you will be able to preview the color on the &quotName&quot <br />
<br />
<font size= '14' color='#fce253' face='RobotoCondensedBold'>Player Marker Color</font><br />
The Player Marker Color will allow you to change the color in which the Player 3D Marker is displayed, you can select them from a drop down list which will give you a decent amount of colors to pick from. On the right of the NAK Pad you will be able to preview the color on the Hexagonal Marker<br />
<br />
<font size= '14' color='#fce253' face='RobotoCondensedBold'>Sway and Recoil Settings</font><br />
NAK Squad has allowed players to use &quot;NoSway&quot; mods for a long time, and it is one of the more popular mods used by players.  NAK Squad's VileAce released a No Sway/No Recoil mod when the most popular one began having issues.  One of the most requested features is to make the recoil and sway adjustable.  Instead of releasing the mod with that feature, NAK Squad has decided to include the ability right within the player settings.<br />
To change the sway and recoil amounts change the slider to the value you wish.  The number represents the multiplier of the sway or recoil default value based on the weapon’s default.  A value of .50 would multiply the default value in half.  Some sample values to try: .15 Sway and .30 Recoil.<br />
<br />
<font size= '14' color='#fce253' face='RobotoCondensedBold'>Halo Jump Altitude</font><br />
Selecting your halo altitude has always been an option, but you had to select the altitude each time you halo jumped.  Most players use the same setting each time, requiring extra clicks each time you halo jumped.  Using the NAK PAD Players settings you can now set your preferred halo altitude and each time you halo, your height will be set.  To change your halo altitude simply select the &quot;Player Settings&quot; from the NAK PAD and change your default altitude.<br />
<br />
<font size= '14' color='#fce253' face='RobotoCondensedBold'>Players Marker Range</font><br />
The Players Marker Range allows you to change the distance at which you’ll be able to see the markers, by default it is set to a distance of 2500 meters and as the distance increases the markers start fading.<br />
<br />
<font size= '14' color='#fce253' face='RobotoCondensedBold'>Player 3D Marker</font><br />
The Player 3D Marker shows an indicator on friendly units - With this option you can either enable or disable the function, it works in combination with the other previously mentioned options which will allow you a good amount of customization.<br />

<br />
<font size= '14' color='#fce253' face='RobotoCondensed'>NAK Squad is now providing a rank system in game to help you monitor your achievements on NAK servers.  This rank system is different from the rank system in TeamSpeak which is based on hours.  The in game system is based on points for actions completed, such as eliminating enemy vehicles and personnel, completing missions, healing your teammates and more.  Below are the ranks and the points required to earn those ranks.  The points are maintained between server sessions, so you will maintain your points when you return.</font>

As we have no way of confirming an individual’s age, if an Admin believes that you are underage you may be asked to leave the server.

<font size= '14' color='#ab2b2c' face='RobotoCondensedBold'>Third offense: Permanent ban</font><br />
Definition: NAK Squad has decided not to allow the recording of any TeamSpeak communications. Federal and State laws of the United States prohibit the unauthorized, non-consensual interception or recording of “wire, oral, or electronic communications”. TeamSpeak is a communication program and therefore falls under these laws. NAK Command decided, to avoid any risks, that prohibiting the recording or streaming of TeamSpeak was the prudent decision.   You are free to record and stream all in-game only communication.  For more information about Streaming see our Streaming Rules and Guidelines.<br />

If you find a way to ‘cheat’ do not take advantage of it and report it to an admin. As for mods, NAK has a list of mods that are allowed on the server, you can find that list at https://www.naksquad.net/mods/approved-mods/. Using any mod, not on that list is considered a violation of this rule. If you receive a script restriction when connecting to the server, you are very likely using an unapproved mod.<br />

If an Admin finds an unfitting behavior he will moderate it accordingly.  We NAK Squad reserve the right to refuse access/service to anyone, at any time, for any reason.
<br />
<font size= '14' color='#fce253' face='RobotoCondensedBold'>If there is no Admin online please do not take actions into your own hands.

On our servers we do restrict the use of a few names. The most common are Administrator, Admin and Owner as these may be confused with the real server administrators.

<br />
Yes, however you must be in the UAV Operator role and you must have a UAV Terminal.<br />
<br />
<font size= '14' color='#fce253' face='RobotoCondensedBold'> Why do i get the &quot;don't troll&quot; hint when using my UAV?</font><br />
<br />
Because our base protection is a bit too eager to stop trolls, until we can come up with a fix for this you'll have to sit somewhere outside of base protection. We recommend Boats (N), Boats (S) or Anit-Air Base on the Altis server.<br />
<br />
<font size= '14' color='#fce253' face='RobotoCondensedBold'> Why can't I connect to the UAV?</font><br />
<br />
Sometimes the UAVs are still connected to the prior Operators Terminal. If he disconnects or dies, sometimes the terminal does not delete properly. The only solution at this time is to destroy the UAV, and you yourself must respawn.

<font size= '14' color='#fce253' face='RobotoCondensedBold'>Why won't the server let me connect with my profile name?</font><br />
<br />
On our servers we do restrict the use of a few names. The most common are Administrator, Admin and Owner as these may be confused with the real server administrators. We also do not allow any name that might be obscene or offensive. We do offer a document that takes you through the steps to change your profile name if you might need some help.

<br /><font size= '14' color='#fce253' face='RobotoCondensedBold'>What is Invade and Annex?</font><br />
<br />
NAK Invade and Annex is a cooperative Arma mission where NATO forces complete primary and side missions against CSAT and FIA forces.  The Main mission may have one or more sub-task in order to complete the mission, where side missions normally have a single task.  To complete the missions NATO forces have a virtual arsenal available to equip the soldiers, and many vehicles to choose from.  For more information about the mission, open the map (m - default) and click TASKS from the list on the upper left-hand corner. This will provide more information about what needs to be done in order to complete the task.  Remember this is a cooperative mission, for the most fun you want to work with other players and for that communication is key.

From the action menu   : select &quot;View Distance&quot;<br />
If you have the <font size= '14' color='#fce253' face='RobotoCondensedBold'>CBA_A3 : press CTRL + \</font><br />

<font size= '14' color='#fce253' face='RobotoCondensedBold'>A3. Mods – Lets face it, Arma would not be Arma without the mods. If you aren’t modding Arma you are missing out on a lot of the fun.</font><br />
But running mods does comes at a cost and not all mods are created equal. It is important to run mods that are optimized as best as they can.<br />
Mods that have too high quality will <font size= '14' color='#fce253' face='RobotoCondensedBold'>kill frames</font>. Mods that have lots of scripts running in the background <font size= '14' color='#fce253' face='RobotoCondensedBold'>will kill frames</font>.<br />
Be very selective of the mods you run. Consider the reason that you are loading a mod and if you are even actually using it. <br />
A single mod can mean the difference between 35 and 45 fps. But let’s face it, some mods are worth the cost.<br />
<br />
<font size= '14' color='#fce253' face='RobotoCondensedBold'>A4. SSD - It makes a vast improvement in the performance of Arma to have the game and your mods installed on a SSD, preferably a single SSD.</font><br />
One of the biggest causes of low frame rate and in particular sudden dips or stuttering frames is the resources required to load the textures. <br />
With SSDs being faster than mechanical hard drives you won’t notice an FPS increase so to speak but you will isolate and remove FPS dips and stuttering you see in the game.<br />
<br />
<font color='#e00000'>If you don't have a SSD, make sure you regularly DEFRAG your HDD to keep it running as optimally as possible.</font>

Have a mic and frequent our TeamSpeak server. Our primary means of communication is with us on our TeamSpeak server, therefore communicating in TeamSpeak and encouraging others to do the same improves game play greatly.<br />
Report bugs or issues with our servers. NAK Command makes every effort to make sure that the servers run smoothly, but sometimes the things don’t work as expected. By reporting bugs or issues with the servers, you are helping make NAK a better place.<br />
Have self discipline. It is important that NAK Elite and those wanting to become NAK Elite follow the rules of the community. Anyone that wishes to be NAK Elite should not have any disciplinary actions within the last 12 months.<br />
Integrity. Becoming NAK Elite is one of the first steps to becoming more involved with the NAK community. It is important that everyone feels that you are honest, fair, and are of good character.<br />
Have 50 hours or more on NAK servers.  Some of our standards for NAK Elite take time to evaluate, therefore anyone being considered will have at least 50 hours of combined gameplay on any NAK server.

To apply for NAK Tac, complete the NAK Tac application: https://naksquad.net/nak-full-tactical-unit/. If you considered applying for NAK Tac in the past but did not because you were not able to attend the required number of event, or you did not because you did not like having to play a specific role for 6 months at a time, consider applying now.<br />
At this point the NAK Tac events are run similar to any other Zeus event, except it is limited to NAK Tac members, so you know the players are there to play a truly cooperative mission, and second we utilize ACE3 and TFAR to enhance the Arma 3 realism.<br />
