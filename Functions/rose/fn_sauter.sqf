	Name: playerJump.sqf
	Version: 1.0.1
	Author: soulkobk (soulkobk.blogspot.com)
	Creation Date: 12:00 PM 11/05/2016
	Modification Date: 7:52 PM 13/11/2016
	
	Description:
	This jump script is to replace any/all glitchy/buggy jump scripts. This script will NOT visually
	glitch your screen when jumping. This script can be used in a single and multi player environment.
	
	In order to use it, place the following line in your init.sqf...
	[] execVM "addons\playerJump\playerJump.sqf"; // (adjust mission directory pathing as needed).
	
	Players jump key will be a combination of SHIFT and 'STEP OVER' (default 'v' key), so a more
	plug-n-play solution is met (no custom key bindings).
	
	*Please note that the ONLY animation available for jump within ArmA 3 currently is when a player
	has a primary weapon in their hands. The jump animation does not show proper with no weapon in
	the hands of the player... ArmA 3 bug.
	
	Parameter(s): none
	Example: none
	
	Change Log:
	1.0.0 -	original base script.
	1.0.1 -	changed displaySetEventHandler to displayAddEventHandler. changed key bindings to use
			run/sprint (SHIFT) and 'GET OVER' (default 'v' key) for jumping. slight changes to
			SL_fn_jumpOver routine and displayAddEventHandler string. player can now also jump
			whilst crouch running.
