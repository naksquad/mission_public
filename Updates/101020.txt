Rules Updated in all locations to reflect current rules
Add Recruit AI (Fixed AI recruits able to spawn on Carrier)
Add Mortar Static weapon drop
Formatted NAK Pad screens to be consistent size and colors for icon and text
Fixed time on NAK Pad to show leading and trailing zeros
Minor Bug Fixes
Added Backpacks to supply drops (Requested by Wave)
Changed Vehicle not available signs to say "The Vehicle Will Respawn At %1:%2 Game Time" instead of "Zulu Time"
Added check on Personalized Ammo (any inventory), so player can not load restricted magazines. (Similar to on arsenal exit check)
Implemented Server With Arsenal Blacklist - Left the on arsenal exit check as a backup until we are sure that the blacklist works as expected.  The is a slight delay to opening the arsenal for each player the first time.
Updated magazine blacklist to prevent HE rounds.
Updated Trigger around infantry and airport.  Some vehicles were getting through

Please do not misuse or abuse the AI recruit feature.  If this feature is misused we may have to remove it.

For all rule enforcement your AI is you and you are your AI.
You must be a pilot or NAK Elite for your AI to pilot a vehicle.
You must have visual contact of your AI at all times, unless they are rejoining you.
